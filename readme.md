# Deep Gaming SCP-RP Issues
This repository is for tracking issues with addons and the map in Deep Gaming SCP-RP

Please do not post bugs that are related to the source engine itself or Garry's Mod as we cannot fix these, however if there is an issue with the configuration of something, an addon, or the map you are free to post it here.


# Reporting a bug
Before making an issue, ask yourself the following:
- Has this issue been made before? (If so, is there anything I can add to the issue in the form of a comment?)
- Is this issue something the Deep Gaming development/mapping team can fix? (We can not fix source engine or Garry's Mod bugs)
- Does this issue truly affect my experience playing Deep Gaming SCP-RP? (If it is very minor you can ask in the #help channel in our Discord)
- Am I the only one experiencing this problem? (If so, ask in the #help channel of the Deep Gaming SCP-RO Discord)
